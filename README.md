# Siffy(now is only RUS)
## About it:
  A free mp3 player that will evolve and guarantee convenience in the future, as well as purely for my experience.
## How to use source code?
```bash
pip install yt-dlp pygame mutagen pillow
py main.py
```
If the script will be work, and you want to build, then proceed to it:
```bash
pip install cx_Freeze
py build.py build
```

## I will be very grateful if you help with the development and also support me in various ways:
